    <p>
      <strong>JustType</strong> is a Sass library that creates correct
      typography.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Wait. Can typography be correct?
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Yes. Typography was solved centuries ago, through science, by print
      publishers. They created rules for proportionally scaling the size of
      headings, creating whitespace, placing lines on the page, and more, that,
      <em>when systematically applied</em>, yield text that is a joy to read.
      This is one reason why books feel nicer to read in print than on the web.
      Of course, a screen beaming light into your eyes is another reason, but
      there are <strong>tons</strong> of improvements we can bring to web
      typography to close the UX gap.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to translate the rules of print into code. As it turns out, this
      task is tedious and weird. For example, because text has a line-height,
      the same value of whitespace applied to the margin of a <code>p</code> is
      larger than when it's applied to the margin of an <code>img</code>. There
      are countless minutiae like this to comb through and fix.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      And, anecdotally&mdash;I've wasted countless hours throughout my career
      fiddling with the margins of an <code>h3</code> until it "felt" just
      "right". I'm tired of making these imprecise, manual tweaks constantly.
    </blockquote>

    <p>So... what's the solution?</p>

    <h2>JustType. Hear me out.</h2>

    <p>
      It handles all of that minutiae for you. It ships with a bunch of
      <a href="https://github.com/Awjin/just-type/blob/master/_config.scss">default values</a>
      that generate good, correct typography.  All you have to do is call the
      <code>typography</code> mixin. Then, use all the free time you've
      reclaimed to write good content and make cool things.
    </p>

    <pre><code>@use 'just-type';

main {
  @include just-type.typography;
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      This website is styled with just the default values. To customize them,
      call the <code>configure</code> mixin:
    </p>

    <pre><code>@use 'just-type';

main {
  /* STEP 1 (optional): Configure the module. */
  @include just-type.configure(
    $line-height: 1.4,
    $font-size: 18px,
    $font-stack: (
      'heading': ('PT Serif', serif),
      'body': ('PT Sans', sans-serif),
      'mono': ('Roboto Mono', monospace),
    ),
  );

  /* STEP 2: Use the module. */
  @include just-type.typography;
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      This is especially powerful if you have a static website or blog that
      generates HTML from Markdown, since the <code>typography</code> mixin
      covers every element that Markdown can generate. Configure it once, then
      enjoy your super readable website. As an example,
      <a href="https://awjin.me">this website</a> is styled throughout with
      JustType, and has a blog section made with Jekyll.
    </p>

    <h3>Going Deeper</h3>

    <p>
      To create rhythm and harmony within text, the size of text elements should
      scale at a fixed ratio as they move up the hierarchy. In other words, if
      <code>p</code> is sized at <code>1rem</code>, the smallest heading should
      have a font-size of <code>1rem * ratio</code>, the next heading up should
      have a font-size of <code>1rem * ratio</code><sup><code>2</code></sup>,
      and so on. The same applies to whitespace. JustType has these and other
      typographic rules baked in, which means that no matter what base
      configuration you give it, it will always generate correct styles.
    </p>

      <img class="sad-boi" src="assets/sad-boi.png" alt="Sad boi">
      <figcaption>Writing without JustType: sad</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      There's a few other features too. My favorite is <code>responsive-breakpoint</code>;
      if you configure this, JustType seamlessly changes the font-size from
      static to responsive at the breakpoint. For example, let's say the
      font-size is <code>16px</code> and <code>responsive-breakpoint</code> is
      <code>1200px</code>. JustType calculates how much <code>vw</code> is equal
      to <code>16px</code> at a viewport size of <code>1200px</code>. When the
      breakpoint triggers, font-size is set to this <code>vw</code> value. Then,
      as the viewport increases beyond the breakpoint, font-size scales with it,
      "locking in" the relative size and proportions of the text. It's hard to
      describe in words, so I'd encourage you to resize this window and see how
      the text behaves.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can access all config values by using the getter functions defined in
      the config file, such as <code>config.whitespace()</code>.
    </p>

    <p>
      And here's the default font-stack:
    </p>

    <table>
      <tr>
        <th>Heading</th>
        <td>sans-serif</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Body</th>
        <td>Georgia, serif</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Mono</th>
        <td>Andale Mono, Lucida Console, monospace</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      There's more, but this article is getting too long.

    <h4>Closing Remarks</h4>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Thank you for listening to my opinions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whitespace is hard but always worth it.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your website is text-heavy, JustType could improve the UX
        significantly with just two lines of code.
        <ul>
          <li>
            And as an added bonus, you'll never have to write typographic styles
            again.
          </li>
        </ul>
