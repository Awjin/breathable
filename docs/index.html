    <p>
      <strong>GutenType</strong> is a Sass library that creates correct
      typography.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      Wait. Can typography be correct?
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Yes. Typography was solved centuries ago, through science, by print
      publishers. They created rules for proportionally scaling the size of
      headings, calculating whitespace, positioning lines, etc. that, <em>when
      systematically applied</em>, yield text that is a joy to read. This
      explains why books feel nicer to read in print than on the web. Of course,
      the screen beaming light into your eyes is another big reason, but there
      are <strong>tons</strong> of improvements we can bring to web typography
      to close the UX gap.
    </p>

    <p>
      We need to translate the rules of print into code. As it turns out, this
      task is tedious and weird. For example, because text has a line-height,
      the same value of whitespace applied to the margin of a <code>p</code> is
      larger than when it's applied to the margin of an <code>img</code>. There
      are countless minutiae like this to comb through and fix.
    </p>

    <blockquote>
      And, anecdotally&mdash;I've wasted countless hours throughout my career
      fiddling with the margins of an <code>h3</code> until it "felt" just
      "right". I'm tired of making these imprecise, manual tweaks constantly.
    </blockquote>

    <p>So... what's the solution?</p>

    <h2>GutenType. Hear me out.</h2>

    <p>
      It handles all of that minutiae for you. Calling the <code>press()</code>
      mixin assigns a base font-size to the <code>html</code> element, so that
      all other styles can be derived from <code>1rem</code>. Then, it generates
      the typography system.
    </p>

    <pre><code>@use 'guten-type';

main {
  @include guten-type.press();
}</code></pre>

    <p>
      It ships with a bunch of <a href="https://github.com/Awjin/guten-type/blob/master/_config.scss">default base values</a>.
      This website is styled with those defaults. To customize them, call the
      <code>set()</code> mixin before pressing. Since GutenType has typographic
      rules baked in, it will always generate correct styles from the given
      config.
    </p>

    <pre><code>@use 'guten-type';

main {
  /* STEP 1 (optional): Configure the module. */
  @include guten-type.set(
    $line-height: 1.4,
    $font-size: 18px,
    $font-stack: (
      'heading': ('PT Serif', serif),
      'body': ('PT Sans', sans-serif),
      'mono': ('Roboto Mono', monospace),
    ),
  );

  /* STEP 2: Use the module. */
  @include guten-type.press();
}</code></pre>

    <p>

    </p>

    <p>
      This is especially powerful if you have a static website or blog that
      builds HTML from Markdown, since <code>press()</code> styles every element
      that Markdown can generate. Configure it once, then enjoy your super
      readable website. As an example, <a href="https://awjin.me">this website</a>
      is styled throughout with GutenType, and has a blog section made with
      Jekyll.
    </p>

    <h3>Going Deeper</h3>

    <p>
      One key concept is typographic scale. To create rhythm and harmony, text
      size should scale at a fixed ratio as you move up the hierarchy. If
      <code>p</code> is sized at <code>1rem</code>, the smallest heading should
      have a font-size of <code>1rem * ratio</code>, the next heading up should
      be <code>1rem * ratio</code><sup><code>2</code></sup>, and so on. The same
      applies to whitespace. GutenType does these calculations for you.
    </p>

    <figure>
      <img class="sad-boi" src="assets/sad-boi.png" alt="Sad boi">
      <figcaption>Writing without GutenType: sad</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>
      There's also the concept of a <code>responsive-breakpoint</code>. If set,
      the font-size will seamlessly transition from static to responsive at the
      breakpoint. For example, let's say that font-size is <code>16px</code> and
      the <code>responsive-breakpoint</code> is <code>1200px</code>. GutenType
      calculates how much <code>vw</code> is equal to <code>16px</code> at a
      viewport size of <code>1200px</code>. When the breakpoint triggers, it
      sets font-size to that <code>vw</code> value. As the viewport increases
      beyond the breakpoint, font-size scales with it, "locking in" the relative
      size and proportions of text. It's hard to describe in words, so I'd
      encourage you to resize this window and see how it behaves.
    </p>

    <h4>
      Other Tidbits
    </h4>

    <p>
      You can access all config values with getters like
      <code>guten-type.whitespace()</code> to use in your Sass code.
    </p>

    <table>
      <caption>This is the default font-stack.</caption>
      <tr>
        <th>Heading</th>
        <td>sans-serif</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Body</th>
        <td>Georgia, serif</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <th>Mono</th>
        <td>Andale Mono, Lucida Console, monospace</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <p>
      There's more, but I think it's time to wrap up this post.

    <h2>Closing Remarks</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Thank you for listening to my opinions.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whitespace is hard but always worth it.
      </li>
      <li>
        If your website is text-heavy, GutenType could improve the UX
        significantly with just two lines of code.
        <ul>
          <li>
            As an added bonus, you'll never have to write typographic styles
            again.
          </li>
