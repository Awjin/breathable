# JustType

#### [SEE THE DEMO &rarr;](https://awjin.github.io/just-type/)

JustType is a sass mixin that generates correct typographic styles. Configure it with base values, such as `font-size`, and it'll ensure your text scales responsively to any display.


#### Usage

Include `just-type.scss` in your build.


#### Modifying styles

  - Tweak config values in `lib/config.scss`
  - Dive into `lib/just-typography.scss` for more control

#### Quick testing

Running `docs/make.sh` starts a `sass --watch` session, which outputs a stylesheet for the local demo site, `docs/index.html`.
