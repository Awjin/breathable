# JustType

### [See the demo](https://awjin.github.io/just-type/)

JustType is a simple sass mixin for generating good typography. Feed it base values, such as font size, and it'll create a stylesheet for you.

### Who's it for?

It's for all you hacker-bloggers, itching to publish thoughts to the web. (Perhaps as a jekyll site hosted on github pages?) Let JustType automate the typography, so you can focus on what matters: writing the content.

### Usage

  - You'll likely be tweaking the values in `lib/config.scss`

  - Dive into `lib/style.scss` if you want more control

  - `./run` starts a `sass --watch` session, outputting to `just-type.css`
